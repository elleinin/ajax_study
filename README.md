# ajax_study
Hello! This is a working draft of a re-do of one of my course projects. The site uses AJAX to load dummy text from JSONplaceholder to load articles. As of now, the AJAX application is only touched upon in the Blog/Recent articles portion of this landing page, as it loads an article title, author, and text.
